# project3
Fall 2017

In this project we create a mountain that the user would provide four cordinates to begin, one for each corner of the moutian, then the program would divide that into four mountains with a focal point. Each of those 4 would then have further triangles devised. The programmed was supposed to find a path from a given point that a climber could scale. I ultimately ran out of time to complete the assignment, but it generates a mountain the only part that was missing was Dijkstra's.

Objectives:
Dijkstra's Shortest Path
LinkedList
Moutain Generation

To Run:
call make
./main.o
